* Now `connect_database()` as a `bfc` parameter instead of `path`.

# regutools 0.99.13

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

* Now `connect_database()` uses `BiocFileCache::BiocFileCache()` and
`BiocFileCache::bfcrpath()` to download the database from Dropbox when it's
not available from `AnnotationHub::query()` and caches the file so you
don't have to re-download it multiple times.

version controlled).

# regutools 0.99.1

BUG FIXES

* Address as many errors, warnings and notes as possible from
http://bioconductor.org/spb_reports/regutools_buildreport_20200302121040.html#malbec2_check_anchor. For the Windows error, it's likely related to `mode = "w"` versus
`mode = "wb"` for `utils::download.file()` as in 
https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatialLIBD/commit/7ac24dc72cc75e42c9af8382c661517f4a64f08d.
